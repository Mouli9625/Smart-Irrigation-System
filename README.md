# Smart-Irrigation-System

ABSTRACT:

1) Modern agriculture is increasingly adopting smart technologies to enhance efficiency and
sustainability. The system aims to provide precise control over irrigation processes, ensuring that
plants receive the right amount of water based on real-time environmental conditions.
2) This Smart Irrigation System designed to optimize water usage through the integration of Arduino
microcontrollers, various sensors, and a linear regression algorithm. The Arduino microcontroller
serves as the central processing unit, coordinating data from various sensors.
3) The system incorporates a soil moisture sensor and a temperature sensor to monitor real-time
environmental conditions. A relay module acts as a switch for the water pump, enabling precise
control over irrigation. The LCD display provides users with instant feedback on soil moisture
levels, current temperature, and irrigation schedules.
4) To enhance efficiency, a linear regression algorithm is integrated, utilizing historical data to predict
soil moisture requirements and fine-tune irrigation schedules.
